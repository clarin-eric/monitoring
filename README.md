[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clarin-eric/monitoring.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clarin-eric/monitoring)
Monitoring configuration for networked CLARIN services and applications.

!!! Attention!!!
We use symmetric encryption for the contact_name and email fields of our contacts. If you want to add a contact, 
ask the monitoring admins for the key. Or add the contact and it should be encryptet after the next automated build (if nothing fails).
